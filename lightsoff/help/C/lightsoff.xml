 <title>Playing <application>Lights Off</application></title>
  <para>You progress through the levels either by turning off all of the tiles in a particular level, or using the arrow-shaped buttons near the bottom of the game. These buttons allow you to skip levels, or return to previous levels, without restriction.</para>
   <sect2 id="s2-block-moving">
     <title> Manipulating the Board</title>
      <para>There is only one action available in <application>Lights Off</application>: clicking a tile on the board. You can either click on the tile with the mouse, or use the arrow keys to choose it. The first time you press an arrow key during a game of <application>Lights Off</application>, a cursor will appear, which you can move with the keyboard; pressing enter will click the light below the cursor.</para>
      <para>When a tile is clicked, both it and all of its non-diagonal neighbors will toggle their state. The objective is to turn all of the tiles on the board off.</para>
