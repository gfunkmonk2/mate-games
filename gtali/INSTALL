Compiling without mate:
------------------------

Change to the directory NoMate and do ./configure and make from there.



Compiling yahtzee within CVS source tree:
-----------------------------------------

Top level configure now accepts curses options.  Do ./configure --help
to see what curses options are available.  The most useful will
probably be --without-ncurses to disable ncurses support or
--with-ncurses=/usr/somewhere/ncurses to specify an alternate ncurses
location.



Compiling yahtzee obtained outside CVS source tree:
---------------------------------------------------

Build the binaries

   1) Edit ./Build to set paths correctly on your system and to point to a
      copy of libintl.

   2) ./Build

   make works on my system, but I made some changes to files in mate-games.

To add entries to the mate panel for gyahtzee

   cp mate.desktop MATEPREFIX/share/apps/Games/ 
   cp pix/mate-gyahtzee.png MATEPREFIX/share/pixmaps/



Changing dice pixmaps:
----------------------

If you want, you can make your own dice pixmaps, which will be
loaded at runtime _if_ they are in the directory where you start
gyahtzee (sorry, haven't figured out what the default path should
be yet).  If you want to change the compiled in defaults, replace
the pixmaps in pix/ and rebuild the binary.

The dice pixmaps should all be the same size to minimize
screen flicker and window resizing.  The default dice
are 64x64.  Compile time pixmaps are xpm's.  Pixmaps loaded
at runtime can be in any format imlib recognizes, but
should have names (ideally I guess they should be xpm's but
you could save a gif with an xpm extension and imlib might open
it correctly?):

   mate-dice-1.xpm    --> one pixmap for each number
   mate-dice-2.xpm
   mate-dice-3.xpm
   mate-dice-4.xpm
   mate-dice-5.xpm
   mate-dice-6.xpm

   mate-dice-none.xpm --> This is the X displayed when a die is selected
