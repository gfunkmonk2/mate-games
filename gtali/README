Gyahtzee: Gnomified Yahtzee

Compiling from source:
----------------------

See the file INSTALL for help compiling gyahtzee.


Yahtzee in general:
-------------------

This is an implementation of yahtzee.  Yahtzee is sort of poker with
dice and less $$.  You roll five dice three times and try to create
the best "hand."  Your two rerolls may include any or all of your
dice.


Playing this version:
---------------------

When play starts, you see the results of your first throw of the dice.
Click on the dice you wish to roll again and they will turn into X's
(anybody got a better idea, they can send me a 64x64 pixmap).  When you
have selected all the dice you wish to reroll, press the Roll! button.
When you have a hand you like or have run out of chances to throw
the dice, click on a row corresponding to what you think is your best
scoring combination.  It is very possible to have a score of zero
and if you click on the wrong row, you will be scored accordingly.
(Say for example, you get yahtzee -- 5 of a kind -- and click on the
large straight row, you will receive a zero in your large straigt score).
You can only use each combination once, i.e. once you've entered
something in a slot, you can't change the score later if you roll a
better hand.  Somebody else can write a yahtzee strategy document.

When your turn is up, the computers will play their turns. 

You can change some computer options in the properties window.
