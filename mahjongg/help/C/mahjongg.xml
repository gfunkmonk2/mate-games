    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      &app; is a solitaire (one player) version of the classic Eastern tile game, 
      Mahjongg.  It has all the functionality you expect from a tile or 
      card game.  You can change the type of tiles, the background, and 
      the difficulty level, among other things, in the 
      <link linkend="prefs">Preferences</link> dialog.  
      Other features, like the <link linkend="pause"><guibutton>Pause
      </guibutton> button</link>, make the game more 
      competitive when you play against the clock. 
    </para>

    <sect2 id="history">
      <title>A Brief History of Mahjongg</title>

      <!-- FIXME: Explain more about solitaire version.-->
      <para>
	Mahjongg tile sets are used to play many variations of the original 
	game.  The version of Mahjongg you play is the solitaire one.  Each 
	tile also has a <ulink type="http" 
        url="http://www.xs4all.nl/~korntner/mahjong/fortune/index.html">
        meaning</ulink> associated with it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Mahjongg's origins are not fully known, but many theories have been put 
	forth.  One such theory says that Noah played Mahjongg on the ark because 
	the East hand is dominant, presumably the direction the rains came, in the 
	flood.  Another theory says that the Chinese philosopher, Confucius, made 
	the game.  The three <quote>Cardinal</quote> tiles have the same names as 
	his three Cardinal virtues, Chung (middle) the Red, Fa (prosperity) the 
	Green, and Po (white) the White, corresponding with Benevolence, Sincerity, 
	and Filial Piety.  Still another theory says that Mahjongg is derived from 
	other Chinese games.  <quote>Ya Pei</quote> is played with 32 cards made of 
	wood or ivory and have the same oblong shape as present day Mahjongg tiles.  
	<quote>Ma Tiae</quote> is played with 40 paper cards, similar in appearance, 
	numbering 1 to 9 in four different suits along with the flower cards.  It has 
	been suggested that two brothers made the game, around 1850 A.D., from a 
	combination of these two games.
      </para>

      <para>
	In the early 1900's Mahjongg was introduced into English clubs in Shanghai.  
	Mr. Babcock started the importation of Mahjongg tiles to the Western world.  
	He stripped down the rules to the very basics and even put Arabic numerals 
	on the tiles.  1923 was the height of the Mahjongg craze with major gaming 
	companies, like Parker Bros., Milton Bradley, and United States Playing Card, 
	importing Mahjongg tile sets by the thousands.
      </para>

      <para>
	Many different rules sprang up and in 1924 the Standardization Committee of 
	the American Official Laws of Mah-Jongg was formed to write a rule book.  
	Still today many clubs play by different rules and sometimes even add flower 
	or joker tiles.  Players of the computer version are becoming intrigued with the
	beauty and detail of the hand crafted sets of the 1920's and 1930's and are
	searching antique shops and flea markets for sets of their own. Many new
	players are being introduced to the game solely through the solitaire
	version and are slowly realizing the intrigue and challenge that the
	traditional game offers.

    <title>Playing Mahjongg</title>

    <para>
      You start with five levels of tiles which are stacked so some are 
      covered up by the tiles on top.  The harder the level you set in the 
      <link linkend="prefs"><interface>Preferences</interface> dialog</link>, 
      the more tiles are covered when the game starts.  The object of 
      &app; is to remove all the tiles 
      from the game.  To remove tiles you have to find matching pairs which 
      look alike.  A matching tile will usually have the same number of buttons 
      or markings on it or will look similar to each other.
    </para>

    <para>
      As an example, the highlighted tile, in the <link linkend="mahjongg-fig">
      figure below</link>, has six buttons.  The matching tile is the one which 
      also has six buttons.  The tile is on the right-hand end of the third row from the bottom and there is another near the top of the fourth row from the bottom.
      If you want to match the tile on the top level, you need to look for the 
      tile with the same green bamboo symbols.  Do you see a matching tile yet?  
      There are three tiles, which are visible, that match the tile on the top 
      level.  Two are to the left and the lower right. The third one is on the top row, but you can't
      remove that tile yet because the tile isn't 
      on the outside of the stack of tiles.  Later you will learn which 
      tiles can be removed and which tiles can't be removed even though they match.
      Find the other two matching tiles, which are visible, on your own.
    </para>

    <para>
      &app; is played by 
      clicking on two matching tiles that are then removed. Play
      continues until all the tiles are removed or there are no
      available pairs.
    </para>

    <para>
      Only tiles at the far left and right edges on each level 
      can be selected.  This is because you can't remove any tiles which 
      aren't at the far left and far right sides.  If the tiles are on 
      a different level and at the left or right sides, those can be removed 
      when you find another matching tile.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you can't match any more tiles, a 
      dialog will appear telling you no more tiles can be matched and giving 
      you the option of shuffling the tiles (adding an additional 60 seconds 
      penalty to the game clock), starting a new game or undoing your
      last move (although you may have to undo many more moves to find your mistake).
