"Mahjongg's origins are not fully known, but many theories have been put "
"forth. One such theory says that Noah played Mahjongg on the ark because the "
"East hand is dominant, presumably the direction the rains came, in the "
"flood. Another theory says that the Chinese philosopher, Confucius, made the "
"game. The three <quote>Cardinal</quote> tiles have the same names as his "
"three Cardinal virtues, Chung (middle) the Red, Fa (prosperity) the Green, "
"and Po (white) the White, cooresponding with Benevolence, Sincerity, and "
"Filial Piety. Still another theory says that Mahjongg is derived from other "
"Chinese games. <quote>Ya Pei</quote> is played with 32 cards made of wood or "
"ivory and have the same oblong shape as present day Mahjongg tiles. "
"<quote>Ma Tiae</quote> is played with 40 paper cards, similar in appearance, "
"numbering 1 to 9 in four different suits along with the flower cards. It has "
"been suggested that two brothers made the game, around 1850 A.D., from a "
"combination of these two games."

"In the early 1900's Mahjongg was introduced into English clubs in Shanghai. "
"Mr. Babcock started the importation of Mahjongg tiles to the Western world. "
"He stripped down the rules to the very basics and even put Arabic numerals "
"on the tiles. 1923 was the height of the Mahjongg craze with major gaming "
"companies, like Parker Bros., Milton Bradley, and United States Playing "
"Card, importing Mahjongg tile sets by the thousands."

"Many different rules sprang up and in 1924 the Standardization Committee of "

"Still today many clubs play by different rules and sometimes even add flower "
"or joker tiles. Players of the computer version are becoming intrigued with "
"the beauty and detail of the hand crafted sets of the 1920's and 1930's and "
"are searching antique shops and flea markets for sets of their own. Many new "
"players are being introduced to the game solely through the solitaire "

"You start with five levels of tiles which are stacked so some are covered up "

"As an example, the highlighted tile, in the <link linkend=\"mahjongg-fig\"> "

"also has six buttons. The tile is on the right-hand end of the third row "
"from the bottom and there is another near the top of the fourth row from the "
"bottom. If you want to match the tile on the top level, you need to look for "
"the tile with the same green bamboo symbols. Do you see a matching tile yet? "
"There are three tiles, which are visible, that match the tile on the top "
"level. Two are to the left and the lower right. The thrid one is on the top "
"row, but you can't remove that tile yet because the tile isn't on the "
"outside of the stack of tiles. Later I'll explain more fully which tiles can "
"be removed and which tiles can't be removed even though they match. I'll let "
