    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para>
    &app; is an application to generate and play the popular
    Sudoku logic puzzle (also known as Number Place).
    </para>
    <para>

        The rules of Sudoku are quite simple. In order to complete the
        puzzle, you must fill each square with a number between 1 and
        9 such that every row, column and 3x3 box on the board
        contains the numbers 1 through 9.  Stated another way, you
        must fill each square such that no number appears twice in the
        same row, column, or 3x3 box.
	
    </para>

    <para>
        These two different ways of looking at the puzzle are two of
    the principle ways players think as they play. On the one hand,
    you ask yourself, “How can I fit all the numbers in this
    box?” On the other hand, you ask yourself, “What
    numbers can fit in this square without causing a conflict with
    other numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box?”

    </para>

    <para>

    In spite of the simplicity of the game, Sudoku puzzles can vary
    widely in their difficulty. &app; allows you to select the
    difficulty of the puzzle you want to play. By default, it will
    begin with easy puzzles and gradually increase the difficulty of
    puzzles as you improve.

    </para>

  </sect1>

<!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
<!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
     to start the application and to describe the user interface components
     of the application. If there is other information that it is important
     for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
     also include this information here. 
     If the information about how to get started is very short, you can 
     include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

    In the puzzle selector screen, the difficulty of the puzzle is

    the difficulty. A dark red puzzle is harder than a light red
    puzzle, for example.

    MATE Sudoku can print games for you to play on paper. This is useful if you have to leave the computer but want to finish a game you have started, or if you want to print out a bunch of puzzles to do later.

	<guimenu>Game</guimenu> 
	<guimenuitem>Print multiple sudokus</guimenuitem> 
      </menuchoice>.</para>

      <para>You will then see a print dialog that lets you choose how

      to print on each page (the more games you print per page, the

      <para>You can also select the range of difficulty you want the games to be in. The games will print in order of difficulty from easiest to hardest.</para>

  <title>Limited Puzzle Statistics</title>

    <para>MATE Sudoku ranks puzzles based on the number of squares that can be rapidly filled. The puzzle statistics box shows you the overall rating and shows you three pieces of information:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>The number of squares fillable by elimination, starting from the blank grid (i.e. only a 2 can go in this box, so it must be a 2).</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>The number of squares fillable by filling, starting from the blank grid (i.e. only only one square in this row can be a 2, so it must be a 2).</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>The number of times in solving the puzzle that the computer had to use trial-and-error, or “guessing”, to solve the puzzle.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>

    Many users are upset to know that the computer solver uses
    trial-and-error, especially since some Sudoku gurus say you should
    never guess to solve a puzzle. There are a number of other
    algorithms that can be implemented to help the computer solve
    sudoku, such as the swordfish and X-wings patterns. 

    </para>

    <para>

    At present, &app; only uses the two algorithms described above as
    well as trial-and-error. When the statistics box says that &app;
    needed to use trial-and-error X number of times, it does
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that a human would have to use
    trial-and-error to solve the puzzle.
