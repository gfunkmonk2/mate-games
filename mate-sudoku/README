This is the first release of MATE Sudoku in mate-games. 

There are many sudoku games in the world. For that reason, I've not
focused on making this cross-platform -- this is very much a MATE
app.  That said, the basic sudoku-solving and generating code works
anywhere.

MATE Sudoku takes care to generate valid sudoku -- symmetrical
puzzles for which there is a unique solution. If it generates a puzzle
that is not unique, this is a bug.

See the FAQ for some more information on sudoku itself and the game.

To execute mate-sudoku from the source tarball:
- First run ./configure && make
- Then run this command in the mate-sudoku directory: ./src/mate-sudoku
