    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      &app; is a four-in-a-row game for the MATE Project.
      The object of the game is to build a line of four of your marbles
      while trying to stop your opponent (human or computer) building a
      line of his or her own. A line can be horizontal, vertical or
      diagonal.
    </para>

    <para>
      To run &app;, select
      <guimenuitem>&appname;</guimenuitem> from the
      <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the
      <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, or type
      <command>gnect</command> on the command line.
    </para>

    <para>
      &app; is included in the <filename>MATE-games</filename> package,
      which is part of the MATE desktop environment. This document describes
      version &version; of &app;.

        To start a new game of &appname; choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Game</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Game</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <interface>game board</interface> consists of seven columns and
        six rows. Above it, a special row indicates the current player and the marble about to be played. Each move consists of dropping a marble in one of the columns. The marble lands on the topmost empty row of the chosen column.
      </para>
        
      <para>To make a move, click on a column with the mouse. To play with the keyboard, move the marble in the top row with the left and right arrow keys, and drop it in place with the  down arrow key. Your marble will drop into the topmost empty row of that column.

        The game is won when one of the two players manages to line up four

        board fills up without a win, the game ends in a draw.

      <para>
        Tiles three and four will be repeated over the game board and
        top row unless a full window background image is specified in the
        theme file.
      </para>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para>
          PNG format is recommended for tile sets. The first, second, fifth
          and sixth tiles should contain some transparency if you want the
          background to show through. The third and fourth tiles should be
          solid, with no transparency, even if you'll be using a full
          window background image with your theme.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para>
          Tiles can be square or rectangular, and any size you like. Most
          of the tile sets that come with &app; use square tiles measuring
          50 pixels by 50 pixels.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        For a full window background image, there's a bit more work to do.
        Let's say your tiles measure 50 by 50 pixels each. The game's display
        measures 7 by 7 tiles, including the top row, so the ideal background
        image for your tile set measures 350 by 350 pixels.
      </para>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para>
          &app; will automatically scale the background image if it doesn't
          match the tile set. This means you can make "large" and "small"
          versions of your theme, both using the same background image,
          just by having a large and a small version of your tile set.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        So, you now have a tile set and perhaps a background image to
        go with it. The next step is to put them in the right place.
      </para>

    </sect2>


    <sect2 id="directories">

      <title>Putting It Together</title>

      <para>
        The last step is to put your image(s) where &app; can
        find them. You could put them in Four-in-a-row's install directory (which will
        depend on your particular system), but your home directory's probably
        a better idea.
      </para>

      <para>
        Make a <filename class="directory">~/.gnect</filename> directory,
        and a <filename class="directory">~/.gnect/pixmaps</filename>
        directory. Those names are important, as &app; won't look
        anywhere else.
      </para>

      <para>
        Copy your image(s) into the pixmaps directory.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you start &app; from the command line, it'll give you clues about
        any problems it has with your new theme. If it has none, you'll
        find your new theme listed the
        <interface>Preferences Dialog</interface>.
