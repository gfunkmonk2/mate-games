"""Module implementing the chess rules.

To use create an instance of the chess board:
>>> b = board.ChessBoard()

Board locations can be represented in two forms:
o A 2-tuple containing the file and rank as integers (see below).
o A string with the location in SAN format.

e.g. The black king is on the square (4,7) or 'e8'.

The chess board with rank and file numbers:

             Black Pieces

             White Pieces
             
Pieces are moved by:
>>> move = b.movePiece(board.WHITE, 'd1', 'd3')
If the move is not None then the internal state is updated and the
next player can move.
If the result is None then the request is ignored.

A move can be checked if it is legal first by:
>>> result = b.testMove(board.WHITE, 'd1', 'd3')
The returns the same values as movePiece() except the internal state
is never updated.

The location of pieces can be checked using:
>>> piece = b.getPiece('e1')
>>> pieces = b.getAlivePieces()
>>> casualties = b.getDeadPieces()
The locations are always in the 2-tuple format.
These methods return references to the ChessPiece objects on the board.

The history of the game can be retrieved by passing a move number to
the get*() methods. This number is the move count from the game start.
It also supports negative indexing:
0  = board before game starts
1  = board after white's first move
2  = board after black's first move
-1 = The last move
e.g.
To get the white pieces after whites second move.
>>> pieces = b.getAlivePieces(3)

The ChessPiece objects are static per board. Thus references can be compared
between move 0 and move N. Note promoted pieces are a new piece object.

When any piece is moved onPieceMoved() method is called. If the ChessBoard
class is extended this signal can be picked up by the user. If movePiece()
or testMove() is called while in this method an exception is raised.
