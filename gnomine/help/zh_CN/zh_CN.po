"Now we're going to try a complicated example. It illustrates two points. The "
"first is that even if you aren't sure which squares are mined, restricting "
"the possibilities is helpful. The second is that knowing which squares "
"aren't mined is nearly as good as knowing which are mined."

"Assume that, in the figure below, we start off knowing that the top left "
"square is mined and so the two squares marked 2 on the left only require one "
"more mine. Next observe that the left-most 2 implies that one of the covered "
"squares beneath it is mined, but we don't yet know which one. Since at least "
"one of these squares is mined and they are both neighbors of the second 2 "
"then we know that that 2 is also satisfied by one of these two squares (we "
"still don't know which one). This means that the square beneath the 4 is "
"clear because it is also a neighbor of the second 2 and not one of the two "
"squares we identified previously. This one blank square now leaves the 4 "
"with only four neighbors - all of which must be mines. Not only does it tell "
"us which mines surround the 4, it now tells us which of the squares beside "
"the 2 is mined!"

"This sort of situation is tricky. In all the other examples you can learn to "
