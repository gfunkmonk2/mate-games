Resizing of squares added by Donnie Barnes <djb@redhat.com>.

Known bugs/TODO:

o  Colors are incorrect on 8 bit display, I don't know why.
  
o  4 Faces for the following situations:
     1. normal
     2. a mine is to be discovered
     3. lose game
     4. win game 

o Add centering of flags, bombs, and numbers now that the squares can be 
  resized (djb)

o add larger flags, bombs, and numbers for larger settings of square sizes (djb)

o add bounds checking on square size (djb)
