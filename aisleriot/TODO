Things to fix:
  - multi-line statusbar messages text get cuts off in the toolbar on maemo,
    instead of being two lines (and we might need to make the text smaller)
  - consider setting board.c:MAX_DELTA to 0.25 which looks nicer
  - check why some calls in cscmi.c are protected by the exception catcher,
    while others are not
  - now that we put CallData on the stack, we shouldn't need to explicitly
    gc_protect our objects in game.c

Ideas:
  - reimplement game timeout handling (no rule sets require them atm)
  - portrait mode
  - implement a11y

Game features:

Implement the dealable feature. See bug #445955.

games have, or have not, been adapted for particular features. The
