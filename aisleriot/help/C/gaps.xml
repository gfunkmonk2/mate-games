  <para>
    To place all cards in sequence from 2 to king, in suit.

        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Gaps in the leftmost column may be filled by moving a 2 of any suit
  there. A gap to the right of any non-King card may be filled by placing
  the card with the same suit but one rank higher into the gap. Gaps
  following Kings or other gaps may not be filled.
  </para>
  <para>
    Once a card is placed in a sequence starting with a 2 in the leftmost
  slot, it can no longer be moved.
  </para>
  <para>
    If no moves are possible (i.e., all gaps follow Kings),
  double-clicking any card will cause a redeal. Any cards not in sequence
  will be removed, shuffled, and redealt. Only two redeals are allowed.
  </para>

            </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Options</title>

    <para>
     Randomly Placed Gaps on Redeal: Check this to have randomly placed gaps 
 after a redeal. If unchecked, the gaps will always be placed directly to the 
 right of any cards already in sequence after redealing.
    </para>

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each card placed in sequence, starting with a two in the leftmost slot,
    is worth one point.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  48

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Put off making any move that will add a gap after a king for as long as possible.
