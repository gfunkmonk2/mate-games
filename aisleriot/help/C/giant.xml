        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating-colors. Cards are
    moved singly or in groups.  An empty slot in the Tableau can be filled with any card. There is an option to restrict the movement to
    only cards of the same suit. See below.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Tableau in complete rows. The reserve may be empty or
    occupied as you wish.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up from suit from Ace to King.  Top cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible. Double clicking on a Foundation
    will automatically move as many cards as possible to the Foundations.
