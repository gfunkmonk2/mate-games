  <para>
    The Tableau is built down by alternate color.  Builds of cards in
    sequence and alternating color can be moved as a unit.  Empty
    Tableau piles can be filled by Kings or builds starting with a King.
  </para>
  <para>
    Any empty Tableau slots must be filled if possible before dealing
    more cards.  Clicking on the Stock deals one card face up on to each
    Tableau pile.  The last deal places one card face up on the first
    three piles.  There are no redeals.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Foundation is built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in the
    Foundation are no longer in play.
  </para>

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each card placed on to a Foundation scores one point.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Move cards up to the Foundation when you can because the next deal
    may block it.  However since cards in the Foundation are no longer
    in play, you may get stuck later needing that card.  Hopefully this
    conundrum will be the most difficult one facing you today.
