  <para>
    Cards in the tableau are built down by suit.  Cards can only be
    moved singly to another Tableau pile.  However, to ease monotony,
    groups of cards can be moved to Foundation.  An empty slot in the
    Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve.  If the Reserve is
    empty, an empty slot can be filled by a card from the Waste or from
    another Tableau pile.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Reserve exists mainly to deal cards into empty slots of the
    Tableau.  However, when there is only one card left in the Reserve,
    it will become visible and is in play.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste singly.  When the
    Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock,
    maintaining order.  You can go through the deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card
    dealt to first Foundation). New Foundations are started when a card
    of the same rank as the first card placed during the dealing period
    are placed on empty Foundation piles.  Aces are placed on Kings, and
    twos on Aces.  Cards in Foundations are not in play.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    A little planning goes a long way.  Check before piling cards in a
    Tableau.  Remember the three card in a slot rule.
