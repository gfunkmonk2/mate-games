	<para>
		Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
		cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a
		card whose rank is one lower than the base card or with a group of cards
		starting with a card with this rank.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Reserve.  Each deal places one
		card on each pile of the Reserve.
	</para>
	<para>
		The top card of each Reserve pile is always available for play on to
		either the Tableau or the Foundation.  There is no building on the
		Reserve piles.
	</para>
	<para>
		Foundations are built up in suit from the base card.  New Foundations
		are started when a card of the same rank as the base card is placed on
		empty Foundation piles.  Aces are
		placed on Kings, and twos on Aces.  Cards in Foundations are still in
		play.  Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate
		Foundation pile if such a move is possible.

	<para>
		The deeper something is, the harder it is to get to.  Try and move cards
