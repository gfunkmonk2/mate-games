    Move all cards to the foundation piles.

        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no
  moves are available (or you just feel like it), click on the empty top
  left slot for a redeal.
  </para>
  <para>
    Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each
  other in order, starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply
  turned over and redealt, four cards at a time, back to the tableau. If no
  moves are made, redealing will not alter the arrangement of the
  cards. Therefore, the game is lost if no move is possible immediately
  after a redeal.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note: a degenerate case occurs whenever, after a redeal, the last
  tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from
  the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only
  results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if
  this situation is detected.
