        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

	<para>
		All exposed cards in the pyramid are available for play.  Build on to
		the Waste from these available cards whenever possible by playing a
		card with a rank immediately above or immediately below the rank of
		the top card in the Waste.  Aces are both above Kings and below Deuces.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste.  There is no redeal.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

	<para>

		first, with an eye out to try to expose as many cards as possible.
