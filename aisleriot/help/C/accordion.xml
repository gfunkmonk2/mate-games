			Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up
            one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows 
            simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the 
            rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space
            of the row below.

  <para>
    Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank
    that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left.
    The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the 
    right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap.
    Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space 
    to the left.

  <para>
    This is a diffcult game. Try to find two or three cards of the same rank at or near the 
    last row. Try not to remove any card of this rank. At the end you can move these cards
    onto each other to win.
