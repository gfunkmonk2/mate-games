        <sect2><title>Goal</title>

  <para>
    Have all the cards in the Tableau, each slot containing Ace to King
    of one suit. Avoid going crazy achieving this.
  </para>

        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    If any two cards dealt on to the Tableau are the same suit and in
    sequence, place the lower card on to the higher. Aces are low,
    Kings are high and sequence does not wrap.  Click on the Stock
    to fill in the empty slots that are made.
  </para>
  <para>
    When no plays can be made in the Tableau, click on the Stock to
    deal a card on to the Waste. If this card can be played on to any
    of the Tableau piles, do so. Repeat this process until there are no
    more moves in the Tableau or from the Waste.
  </para>
  <para>
    At this point, clicking on the Foundation again moves all the cards
    in the Tableau back to the bottom of the Stock.  The card in the
    Waste is put in the first Tableau pile and the rest of the Tableau
    is filled with one card to each pile from the Stock.

    There is no scoring in this game.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    A great game for killing time, Valentine really has no strategy,
    unless the strategy is to play it instead of doing other, more
    important things, like going to bed.
