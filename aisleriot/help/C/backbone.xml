    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit.  Only one card can be moved
    at a time.  Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck twice.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in the
    Foundations are no longer in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is
    possible.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards. Be careful
    with Kings in the Reserve: the only way to remove them is by playing them
    to a Foundation on top of a Queen.
