	    Seven piles.  Four rows, the first row is face down, 
	    the second row is face up, the third row is face down, and 
	    the fourth and final row is face up.  
	    Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening 
	    layout is different.  
	    <!-- TODO FIXME link to Klondike Help page -->
	    Tableau can be built down in alternating colors.  Builds of
	    cards can be moved.  Empty piles can only be filled by Kings
	    or group of cards starting with a King.

    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Builds of
    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
  </para>

<!-- TODO 
  <sect2><title>Options</title>
  <para>
    Three card deals: If checked, the Stock will deal three each time.
    Otherwise, the Stock will deal singly into the Waste.
  </para>
  <para>
    King Only: If checked empty space may be filled with Kings or 
    groups of cards starting with a King only.

  <para>
    Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.

  </sect2>
  <sect2><title>Strategy</title>
  <para>
    Don't give up the ship!  Try brute force methods when the game seems
    over.  Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the
    Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
