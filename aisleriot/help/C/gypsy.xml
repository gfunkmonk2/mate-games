        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Cards in Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Builds of
    cards can be  moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
    with any card or build of cards.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the
    Tableau.  There are no redeals.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card in the
    Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a
    move is possible.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each card in the Foundation scores 5 points.  When a Foundation pile
    is complete (from Ace to King), 60 more points are scored.  Each
    card pair on the Tableau in alternating order scores 2 points.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  1000
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Try and expose new cards in the Tableau whenever possible.  Remember
    you can always bring cards from the Foundation back into play.
