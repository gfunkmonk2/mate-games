	<para>
		Any card of the suit in the first Foundation can be played on to this
		Foundation pile at any time. Each ensuing Foundation can only be
		started with a card of the same rank as this first card.  Once
		started, these latter foundations can be built on in suit as long as a
		card of the same rank already exists in the Foundation directly above
		it.  Play cards from Reserves whenever possible following these rules.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top card in
		Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to
		the Stock, maintaining order.  You can go through the deck three times.
