  <para>
    The top card on each Tableau can be moved to another Tableau pile if
    it has a value of one lower than the top card on the second pile.
    Suit is not relevant.  Empty Tableau piles cannot be filled.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card in the
    Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a
    move is possible.
