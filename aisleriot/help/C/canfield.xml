        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

	<para>
		Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
		cards can be moved.  An empty slot in the Tableau is filled
		automatically from the Reserve.  If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot
		can be filled by any card or group of cards in sequence.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste by three.  If the last
		flip has less than three cards, that many cards are flipped for that
		move only.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the
		Stock, maintaining order.  
	</para>
	<para>
		Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to
		first Foundation)  New Foundations are started when a card of the same
		rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on
		empty Foundation piles.  Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on Aces.
		Cards in Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will
		move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

	<para>
		Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.  This game used to
		be played in casinos.  You would break even if your score is 10.
	</para>
	<para>
		Maximum possible score:  52

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

	<para>
		A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.  This game is hard to win.
		Most people play with the betting rules in mind and try to get as many
		points as possible.  To this end, always move cards into the Foundations
		as soon as they are available.
