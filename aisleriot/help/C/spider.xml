        <sect2><title>Goal</title>

	<para>
		To have eight sequences of cards going down from King
		down to Ace in the foundation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you want an extremely difficult challenge, do not move completed
    sequences of cards to a foundation.
    You can also win by leaving the same eight sequences in the tableau.
    This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact,
    it is nearly impossible.
	</para>

	        </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

	<para>
		Build down regardless of suit.  Sequences of cards in the same suit can
		be moved as a unit.  Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
		sequence.
	</para>
	<para>
		Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
		pile.  However, all piles must be non-empty.  If an empty pile exists,
		an error message will appear.
	</para>
	<para>
		A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile.  Once
		there, these cards are no longer in play.
	</para>

  <para>
    There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>One Suit</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The deck is an octuple deck of Spades only. This is the simplest of the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>    
    <varlistentry><term>Two Suits</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The deck is a quadruple deck of Hearts and Spades only. There are four complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is not quite as diabolical as the standard four suit spider deck.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>Four Suits</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The deck is a standard double deck. There are two complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is the standard Spider deck. It is also the most difficult.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  
  <para>Many traditional implementations of Spider do not use a foundation
  and simply remove completed sequences of cards. This has no impact upon game
  play.</para>

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

	<para>
		For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).

	<para>
		If at first you don't succeed, don't become addicted.  Build in suit
		whenever possible, but expose as many cards as you can.
