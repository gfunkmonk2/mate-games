  <para>
    Cards can be removed in pairs if they add up to fourteen (with Jacks
    being 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13) and are in the same row or column.
  </para>
  <para>
    Empty slots are automatically filled from the Stock.  Once the Stock
    is exhausted, cards to the right of empty piles are automatically
    moved over to fill the space, with empty piles in the right column
    filled in by the cards of the leftmost column in the row below.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Oftentimes in the middle of this game, there is only one move.  Make
    it.  Once the Stock is exhausted, there is much more movement in the
    Tableau.
