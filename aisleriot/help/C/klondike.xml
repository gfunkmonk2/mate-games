    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.

        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is
    possible. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Double clicking on a foundation card will move all the cards that
    can be moved to the foundation to the foundation. This
    is useful for cleaning up at the end of the game.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Options</title>

  <para>
    There are three possible ways to play. The difference between them
    is in how the cards are dealt from the stock.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>Three card deals</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Cards are dealt from the stock three at a time. There is no limit to how many times you can redeal the stock.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>Single card deals</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time. However you can only turn the stock over and redeal twice.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>No redeals</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Cards are dealt one at a time from the stock. There is no redeal. Play this way if you want a challenge (and some frustration).</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  
  <para>Most likely you will consider one of the first two methods
  traditional - depending on where you live and who taught you. The no
  redeals option is the one normally found in older sets of rules, but
  the game is rarely played that way.</para>

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  52
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Don't give up the ship!  Try brute force methods when the game seems
    over.  Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the
    Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
