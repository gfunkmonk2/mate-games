#  Format: A group containing keys with lists of packages.
#  The group name is either [Distribution] (the output of "lsb_release -s -i"),
#  or [Distributor] (the output of "lsb_release -s -d"). If the [Distribution]
#  group doesn't exist, we fall back to the [Distributor] one. In general it should
#  be sufficient to create the [Distributor] group, unless it is necessary to
#  override theme packages for a specific distribution version.
#  The entries are a semicolon-separated list of packages names to install
#  for the given theme format. Note the trailing semicolon! Only the
#  packages for theme formats enabled at compile time will actually
#  be installed.
#
# Distributors:
# If you add your distribution here, please do send a patch upstream by filing
# a bug at http://bugzilla.mate.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mate-games&component=general
